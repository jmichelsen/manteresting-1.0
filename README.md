Manticore
=========

How to setup
------------

Architecture
------------

This prototype was built using Django and Pinax.

It should store images on Amazon S3 in production. This app could be useful:
[django-storages](http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).

Design
------

Project uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework for layout and basic design.
Actually, this Pinax's theme https://github.com/pinax/pinax-theme-bootstrap/
does all job.
